<h2>Credit card balance transfer rounding errors</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered how much more you can transfer  between credit cards without paying more fees?</p>
<p>This tool figures it out for you.</p>
<h3>For example</h3>
<p>If you transfer a $100 credit card balance for a 10% fee...</p>
<p>You will pay a $10 fee.</p>
<p>But you can also transfer $100.04 for the same $10 fee!</p>
<p>You will pay $10.01 to transfer $100.05, however.</p>
