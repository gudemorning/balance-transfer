				<h1>Find extra change</h1>
				<p>I created a website that saves you money using rounding errors.</p>
        <p>Example: Simple loan.
          <ol>
            <li>It calculates the interest you owe on a simple loan</li>
            <li>Then it shows you how much you can borrow for the same amount of interest by taking advantage of rounding.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>It takes advantage of the way we round down fractional pennies until reaching half a penny (then we round up).</p>        
        <p>For example 5% of a penny is blah. So it incrementally adds pennies to your loan until it finds the amount before your interest rounds up to the next penny.</p>
        <p>This applies to any transaction where you're charged a fee based on an interest rate, like credit card balance transfers, credit card cash advances and currency exchanges.</p>
        <p>The amount it adds is based on the percentage interest rate and is always less than a dollar.</p>
        <p>There is no fee to use this (and tall gains are tax free).</p>
