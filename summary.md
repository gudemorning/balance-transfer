# I made a Rounding error tool!

It calculates your balance transfer fee and shows how much more you can borrow for the same fee (thanks to rounding).

It works for non-compounding loans whose fee is based on an interest rate.

I couldn't find a calculator for this so I created my own[https://smallgain.github.io/balance-transfer/
].

It wasn't as easy to create as I thought because Javascript doesn't calculate decimal math accurately.
I had to use LINK TO LIBRARY HERE to fix the decimal calculations.

My design was inspired by @b0rk's simple DNS lookup tool[https://dns-lookup.jvns.ca/trace.html#twitter.com].
